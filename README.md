# The Káto system

**Káto** (from Greek *κάτω*: 'down', 'below', 'underneath') is an opinionated system which governs diverse computing workloads and work-flows.
Like in catabolism (from Greek *κάτω* káto, 'downward' and *βάλλειν* ballein, 'to throw'), the *Káto* system is the catalyst used to breakdown complex monolithic platforms into its fundamental microservices.

# Overview

[CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) is the foundation on which *Káto* is built. It provides the fundamental components used to assemble container-based distributed systems: [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) is used for consensus and discovery, [fleet](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) is a distributed init system, [flannel](https://github.com/coreos/flannel) is used for virtual networking and [rkt](https://github.com/coreos/rkt) and [docker](https://github.com/docker/docker) are container engines.

All this *CoreOS* goodies are used to bootstrap a [Mesos](https://github.com/apache/mesos) cluster. *Mesos* is a distributed systems kernel which abstracts compute resources away from machines. Accordingly, it provides schedulers (or frameworks in *Mesos* parlance) which can run on top in order to utilise the exposed compute resources.

[Marathon](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon) is one of such frameworks. It is a cluster-wide init and control system for long-running applications. Other frameworks like [Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/mesos-plugin) and [Elasticsearch ](https://github.com/mesos/elasticsearch) share the same cluster resources.

[Ceph](https://github.com/ceph/ceph-docker) is a distributed object store and file system designed to provide excellent performance, reliability and scalability. It provides a multi-host persistent data storage for containers.

## Install
```
go get github.com/h0tbird/kato
go build -o ${GOPATH}/bin/katoctl github.com/h0tbird/kato
```

## 1. Deploy Káto's infrastructure

- [x] [Amazon EC2](https://github.com/h0tbird/coreseed/blob/master/docs/ec2.md)

## 2. Start the stack
```
cd /etc/fleet
fleetctl submit zookeeper\@.service
fleetctl start zookeeper@1 zookeeper@2 zookeeper@3
fleetctl start mesos-master.service mesos-dns.service
fleetctl start marathon.service cadvisor.service
