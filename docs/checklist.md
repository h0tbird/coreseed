## Extended checklist

Find below a list of actions used to troubleshoot *KÃ¡to*, this list is based on real issues and their solutions.
Some issues might have been permanently fixed but are keept here for its troubleshooting value.

###### *Disk usage*

Diagnose:
```
loopssh df -h /
```

Mitigate:
```
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=1h
docker rmi $(docker images -qf dangling=true)
```

###### *CoreOS version*

Diagnose:
```
loopssh cat /etc/os-release | grep VERSION=
```

Mitigate:
```
update_engine_client -check_for_update
```

###### *Summary of running containers (not realtime)*
```
for i in $(etcdctl ls /docker/images); do etcdctl get $i; done | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
```

###### *The resource demand for a given task is higher than the available resources co-located on a single worker node. Therefore, the Marathon task stays in the waiting state forever.*

This is not really an error, you can:
- Exo-scale up your cluster.
- Redefine the task so it requires less resources.
- Kill existing tasks in order to free resources.

###### *Multiple Marathon frameworks registered but only one is expected to be up and running.*

Try to teardown the unexpected framework ID:

```
curl \
  -sX POST http://master.mesos:5050/master/teardown \
  -d 'frameworkId=aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee-ffff'
```

###### *Containers on one worker are unable to ping containers on the other workers.*

This is most likely to be a *docker*-*fleet* communication problem. Was *fleet* up and running at the time *docker* started? Run the command below to check whether the IP address assigned by *fleet* to the *docker0* bridge is within the range managed by *fleet*, restart *docker* otherwise:

```
loopssh ip r | grep docker0
```
